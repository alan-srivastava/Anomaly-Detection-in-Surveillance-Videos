TensorFlow Object Detection API

📥 Installation

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/anomaly-detection-surveillance.git
cd anomaly-detection-surveillance
Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
✅ The model files are downloaded automatically when the script is first run.

▶️ Usage
Place your video file (e.g. sample_video_1.mp4) in the project directory.

Run the detection script:
python detect_anomalies.py

⚙️ Customization
Change detection threshold
Edit min_score_thresh in visualize_boxes_and_labels_on_image_array(...).

Use another model
Modify MODEL_DATE and MODEL_NAME at the top of detect_anomalies.py.

🔍 Extend for Anomaly Detection

This project can be enhanced to detect anomalies, such as:

🧭 Behavior Analysis: Track object motion for irregular patterns

🔢 Object Counting: Detect crowding or traffic congestion

🚫 Zone Monitoring: Alert when objects enter restricted areas

🎒 Abandoned Object Detection: Identify items left unattended
